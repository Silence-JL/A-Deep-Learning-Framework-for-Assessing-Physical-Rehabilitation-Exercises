# A-Deep-Learning-Framework-for-Assessing-Physical-Rehabilitation-Exercises

The codes are based on the research project A Deep Learning Framework for Assessing Physical Rehabilitation Exercises. The framework for automated quality assessment of physical rehabilitation exercises encompasses metrics for quantifying movement performance, scoring functions for mapping the performance metrics into numerical scores of movement quality, techniques for dimensionality reduction, and deep neural network models for regressing quality scores of input movements via supervised learning. The proposed framework employs an autoencoder network for dimensionality reduction, a performance metric based on the log-likelihood of a Gaussian mixture model, and a deep convolutional neural network for movement assessment. The spatio-temporal neural network arranges data into temporal pyramids, and exploits the spatial characteristics of human movements by using sub-networks to process joint displacements of individual body parts.
